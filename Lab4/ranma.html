			From Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma 1/2
		</h6>
		
		<p>
			Ranma Saotome is the teenage lead character in the manga and anime series "Ranma 1/2". 
			He was created by Rumiko Takahashi, the writer and illustrator of the original manga series.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Background</h3>
		
		<p>
			Ranma Saotome was born in Japan to a Genma Saotome, a martial artist from the
			school of Anything Goes Martial Arts. As a small child, Ranma was taken by his father to
			undertake rigorous martial arts training while traveling throughout Japan and China.
			It is during his training in China that Ranma falls into a cursed spring and turns into
			a red-haired girl. Ever since then, Ranma turns into a girl whenever he comes in contact
			with cold water and reverts back to being a boy when he comes in contact with warm or hot
			water. He has been engaged to the youngest daughter of his father's best friend to inherit
			Genma's martial arts school.
